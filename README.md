# Human Performance in Hockey
•	Collected event data, line change data and possession data through Catapult Thunder, developed model ready data asset to determine impact of team composition changes on team performance
•	Analyzed lag time between significant hockey events (face off, shot for, etc.) with statistical test of significance (t-test, variance test, chi-square test) with R to analyze key drivers for hockey event timing
•	Created data pre-processing workflows, accounted for corrections by subtracting lag time and making adjustment as needed (Excel)
•	Combined study data into distributable data asset, enabling additional research and future development
